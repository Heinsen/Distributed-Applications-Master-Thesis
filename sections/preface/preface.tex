Several partners for this master thesis were initially considered and contacted. Danske Bank stood out because of their interest in starting a new initiative entitled: TalentBox. A new accelerator that makes it possible for students to work closely together with the internal departments of Danske Bank at the Brabrand Development Center. The accelerator made it possible to gain insights into a modern bank with many different software engineering related problems at hand.
