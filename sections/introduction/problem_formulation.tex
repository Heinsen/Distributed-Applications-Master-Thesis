\subsection*{Notes}
How are the challenges and their optimal solution affected by the specific application?

What determines the optimal application architecture, database and distribution?

How is the optimal application architecture, database and distribution determined?

System architecture:
How is application data optimally stored?
How is application data optimally distributed?

How are application updates optimally executed?
How are updates 

How is the system distributed

This area has been named cloud computing, 

Big cloud computing platforms are now available, offering server rental with 

From these requirements big cloud platforms have been started, 

These requirements has started big scale initiatives in cloud computing, has generated new tools and databases available for development of distributed big scale enterprise applications. 

Creating a need for developers to explore and evaluate which of the many platforms to choose,
