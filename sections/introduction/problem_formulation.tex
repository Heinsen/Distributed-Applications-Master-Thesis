\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sc:problem_statement}
Based on the above I will describe elements in a resilient system 

\begin{itemize}
\item How is the relation between dependability and adaptivity in a resilient system?
\item How is a system optimized for resilience by changing the capacity and redundancy, thereby influencing the availability?
\end{itemize}
