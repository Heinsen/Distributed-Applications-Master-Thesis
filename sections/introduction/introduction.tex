The requirements for enterprise application availability, performance and maintainability are constantly rising. Stemming from high amounts of information with unpredictable and varying load, together with a demand for failure free and feature rich platforms. These requirements has opened a new market for big scale cloud-computing services, providing server infrastructure and tools which help resolve these new challenges. Many new possibilities has opened with several open source initiatives within the cloud computing area, creating new ways of both developing and maintaining distributed applications.
