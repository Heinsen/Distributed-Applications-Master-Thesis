The requirements for enterprise application availability, performance and maintainability is constantly rising. Stemming from high amounts of information with unpredictable and varying load, together with a demand for failure free and feature rich platforms. These requirements has opened a new market for big scale cloud-computing services, providing server infrastructure and tools which help resolve these new challenges. A lot of new possibilities has opened with many open source initiatives, giving new possibilities when deploying, scaling and updating applications, with containerization as the enabling technology. The cloud-computing services are constantly expanding and reiterating tools, trying to capture the market.
